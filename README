All of the requirements for the complier work. 

Instructions to Run complier:
	Naviagte in the termial to the bin folder.
	execute java RunnerNick which will prompt you to enter the name of a source file
	After the program is run it will print out the code to the console and it will create a file with the same 
		name as the sourse file but with "-output" tagged on to the end
	IMPORTANT: We planned on implementing subroutines, but that proved too hard. A result of that is we chaned the langauge to be 
	program => main compound_stmt
	but everyting else is the same.

Additional features:
	(1) reserved space for the varibles used in the program
	(2) add a for loop statment,(see forLoopInput for an example)
	(3) "//" will comment one line that will be ignored in by the complier this is shown working in forlooptest.txt
	(4) Added the ability to generate a list of quads file and a file that the machine lang is in

Input files we made and ran:
	(1) forlooptest.txt
	(2) errordisplay1.txt
	(3) errordisplay2.txt
	(4) classCode.txt
	
Then that generate these files as output:
	(1) forlooptest-outputCode.txt forlooptest-outputQuad.txt
	(2) classCode-outputCode.txt classCode-outputQuad.txt

The error code prompts in standard output:
	(1) Illegal name of identifier on line 7 
		for errordisplay1.txt
	(2) Illegal use of reversed words on line 9
		for errordisplay2.txt
	(3) Miss semicolon on line 11
		for errordisplay3.txt
